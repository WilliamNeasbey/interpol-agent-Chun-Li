Look, no one ever said Chun-li was a nice girl. I beat the crap out of people, more than I have to. Some are even still in the hospital. I've had idiot teachers who like to talk big, so I taught them a lesson, and they never came back to class. If I go to a restaurant and the food's bad, I make it a policy to stiff 'em with the bill.

But, even a bastard like me... can spot true evil when she sees it! True evil are those who use the weak for their own gain, and crush them underfoot when they're through! Especially innocent children! And that is exactly what you've done, isn't it!? And you hide from the victims, the law, and the consequences! That's why... I will judge you myself!
